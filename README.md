# Four-part Harmony Machine

The four-part writing machine project is a plugin that recreates the rules of four-part harmony visually.  It does this by implementing logic that takes tonal pitch classes, note pitch values, whole, and half steps to determine what rules have been broken in a userâ€™s four-part harmony.
